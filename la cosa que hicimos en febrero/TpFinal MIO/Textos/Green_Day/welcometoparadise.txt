Dear mother can you hear me whining?.
It's been three whole weeks
Since that I've left your home.
This sudden fear has left me tremblin'
'Cause now it seems that I am out there on my own
And I'm feeling so alone.
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes.
Some call it slums, some call it nice.
I want to take you through
A wasteland I like to call my home.
Welcome to paradise.
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own.
It makes me wonder why I'm still here.
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go.
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes.
Some call it slums, some call it nice.
I want to take you through
A wasteland I like to call my home.
Welcome to paradise.
Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?.
It's been six whole months since that
I have left your home.
It makes me wonder why I'm still here.
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go.
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice.
I want to take you through
A wasteland I like to call my home.
Welcome to paradise, oh paradise.
