high on a low life hit me with a dull knife sweet sour sickness can i get a witness
this is the wild life im gonna take a dive
take the money and crawl
do i dare say please when im on my knees
take the money and crawl
illegal tender going on a bender coldblooded killers of all motherfuckers
im a nervous wreck enough to make you sick take the money and crawl
oh yeah its just my luck but i dont give a fuck take the money and crawl
this is the wild life im gonna take a dive take the money and crawl
do i dare say please when im on my knees take the money and crawl
so you can take a walk or you can suck my cock take the money and crawl
oh yeah its just my luck but i dont give a fuck take the money and crawl
im the son of rage and love the jesus of suburbia from the bible of none of the above on a steady diet of soda pop and ritalin no one ever died for my sins in hell as far as i can tell at least the ones i got away with
and theres nothing wrong with me
this is how im supposed to be in a land of make believe that dont believe in me
get my television fix sitting on my crucifix
the living room on my private womb while the moms and brats are away
to fall in love we fall in debt to alcohol and cigarettes and mary jane to keep me insane doing someone elses cocaine
and theres nothing wrong with me this is how im supposed to be in a land of make belive
that dont believe in me
at the center of the earth in the parking lot of the were i was taught
the motto was just a lie
it says home is where your heart is but what a shame cause everyones heart doesnt beat the same
its beating out of time
city of the dead at the end of another lost highway
signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned lost children with dirty faces today no one really seems to care
i read the graffiti in the bathroom stall like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
and how it seemed to confess
it didnt say much but it only confirmed that the center of the earth is the end of the world
and i could really care less city of the dead at the end of another lost highway signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned lost children with dirty faces today no one really seems to care
i dont care if you dont
i dont care if you dont
i dont care if you dont care
everyone is so full of shit
born and raised by hypocrites
hearts recycled but never saved
from the cradle to the grave
we are the kids of war and peace from england to the middle east
we are the stories and disciples of the jesus of suburbia
land of make believe and it dont believe in me
land of make believe and it dont believe
i dont care i dont care i dont care i dont care i dont care
dearly beloved are you listening i cant remember a word that you were saying
are we demented or am i disturbed the space thats in between insane and insecure
oh therapy can you please fill the void am i retarded or am i just overjoyed
nobodys perfect and i stand accused for lack of a better word and thats my best excuse
to live and not to breathe is to die in tragedy to run to run away to fight what you believe
and i leave behind this hurricane of fucking lies
i lost my faith to this this town that dont exist so i run i run away to the lights of masochists
and i leave behind this hurricane of fucking lies
and i walk this line a million and one fucking times but not this time
i dont feel any shame i wont apologize when there aint nowhere we can go running away from pain when youve been victimized tales from another broken
