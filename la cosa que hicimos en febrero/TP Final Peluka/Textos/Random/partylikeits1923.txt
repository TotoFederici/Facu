If you could go back to the flapper, dapps and jacks of 1923(nnt) and get all that you wished for - what would you be?.
I'd make whoopee every day, I'd dance the night away
An egg's what I would have been
And I'd host the greatest parties that you'd ever see.


Oh I'd swing swing swing swing swing swing swing I'd swing the night away.
Forget your troubles - party till the break of day.
It would be greater than Great Gatsby's wildest dreams
When we party like it's 1923(nnt).
Look at all the glamour, look at all the style
It's magic in the air.
There's quiffs and bearcats, flappers everywhеre
And you can feel the dixie vibе, you can feel the rythm thrive.
Let's find a juicy joint.

(Let's get boiled as an owl! - Splifficated! - Come on boys!).


So let's swing swing swing swing swing swing swing let's swing the night away.
Forget your troubles - party till the break of day.
It would be greater than Great Gatsby's wildest dreams
When we party like it's 1923(nnt).

Swing swing swing swing swing swing swing let's the night away.
Forget your troubles - party till the break of day.
It would be greater than Great Gatsby's wildest dreams
When we party like it's 1923(nnt).
